# This docker-compose.yml lets you spin up the container with your local code
# mounted as a volume.  You can rebuild the extension without rebuilding the
# whole image
#
# See Dockerfile.dev
#
# To begin developemnt after cloning this repo to your local system,
# do the following fro mthe root directory of the repo:
#
#     docker-compose build jupyter
#     #docker-compose up -d jupyter   # use the next line instead.
#     docker-compose run --service-ports jupyter
#
# The above starts up shell in a running container.
# The `--service-ports` argument specifies that the ports defined by the
# named service should be "published" meaning they are bound to port numbers
# on the localhost.
#
# Once the container starts, at the command-prompt inside the container:
#
#     yarn run build   # transpiles ts -> js
#     yarn build:labextension:dev
#
# Run the unit tests afer it is has built
#
#     yarn test
#
# Make sure you have exported UID and GID.  For example,
#
#     export UID=$(id -u)
#     export GID=$(id -g)
